<!-- A brief description of myself -->

        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Marcel Harvey, born in the year of 1997 in October the 20th. I currently reside in Krugersdorp
            Gauteng and would love to start my career in development
        </p>

        <h3>What do i love?</h3>
        <p>
            I am still young and hungry for success. I want to make a good honest living that can support my passions
            which are working on computers and cars. I love the idea of trying to figure out how and why something works
            like it does, and was never pleased with the idea of "It just works like that". Playing online computer games
            with friends is also one of my favourite things to do when i have the chance. I watch a lot of youtube videos
            especially on new developments, weather it be new algorithms or someone getting a new project car to build
            and fix up.

        <h3>My goals in life</h3>
        <p>
            During the week I want to be able to develop new software programs. It can be making a program for a company
            that needs to keep track of their stock and sales or develop the software for a new electric or combustion
            engine, and on weekends i want to be able to sit in my garage and work on my very own project car. At the
            end of my career i want to be able to say, "Yes, I was successful and got to do what i wanted to in life!".

    <!-- A brief description of my education -->
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            My entire high school career was done at Hoërskool Noordheuwel where my interest started with coding in my
            subject "CAT". At first i did not make much of it, but the more i spoke to people the more i realized there
            is a great career in development.
        </p>

        <p>
            My other education degree is at Hyperion Development, where i studied software engineering. Here i learned a
            lot, the biggest thing being, i still know little of the art of programming and that their is always something
            you don't know
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="blank"></div>


    <div class="text">
        <h3>Work experience</h3>
        <p>
            My first job started as a driver at a company called Warco, that mainly dealt with recycling battery lead.
            There i learned how to talk to people in a professional manner
        </p>

        <p>
            My second job was an alignment technician at a Tiger wheel and Tyre, where i learned a lot about my other
            passion. There i learned about customer service and how it can impact a business.

    <!-- All my current projects in my GitHub with links to them -->
        <h3>Home made Projects</h3>
        <p>
            In my time at hyperion i have learned how to create a lot of new programs in Python and in Java<br>
            Below are some projects on github with links to the repository
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p class="bulletPoint"> <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/Marcel-harvey/Capstone-projects/tree/main/Finance%20Calculator">
                    <b>Finance Calculator</b> </a> </p>
                <p>
                    This program was created using Python<br>
                    This is a basic calculator that calculates the interest rate of you investment, compound or simple
                    interest. This program can also be used to calculate your monthly bond
                    repayment
                </p>

                    <b>My Game to Review</b> </a> </p>
                <p>
                    This program was created using Python<br>
                    This is a basic game that was written using the Pygame module, used to show that i can
                    use a module. The point of the game is to reach the prize icon with out touching
                    one of the enemy icons.

                    <b>Task Manager 1st</b> </a> </p>
                <p>
                    This program was created using Python<br>
                    This is the first variation of the task manager program. The idea of this program is that
                    it can track tasks, view tasks, edit tasks and manage the users that uses the program.
                </p>

                    <b>Task Manager 2nd</b> </a> </p>
                <p>
                    This program was created using Python<br>
                    This is the second variation of the task manager program. In this version a lot of the first
                    version is refactored and most of the programming are moved to functions. New
                    functionality is added to the program specific to the admin
                </p>
            </li>

                <p class="bulletPoint"> <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/Marcel-harvey/Capstone-projects/tree/main/Poised">
                    <b>Poised</b> </a> </p>
                <p>
                    This program was created using Java<br>
                    The poised program was created for a pretend company that requires a program that will help
                    them manage their business. The program allows for the data of all the people
                    involved and the information about the building itself to be stored in text files. These files can then be
                    edited to if there are any changes.
                </p>

                    <b>Poised with database</b> </a> </p>
                <p>
                    This program was created using Java<br>
                    This version of the poised program is almost identical from the previous one. The main
                    difference is that all the data is now stored in a database, instead of text files.
